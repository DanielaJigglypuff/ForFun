Simple python clicker useful for clicking a lot without actually using your finger Pog?

I made a clicker that takes in your current possition and clicks for you ... pretty self explenatory.  
But if you move from that particular position it stops clicking which is neat . 
By default the " clicks" and " interval" are optimum for creating cookies on cookie clicker (also its not detectible by the game which means you dont get the " you cheated" achievements). 

Since i used the pyautogui library here is the pip install link : https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/ and the anaconda one : https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pyautogui

Also i would like to appologise to the cookie clicker devs for creating fake cookies .
